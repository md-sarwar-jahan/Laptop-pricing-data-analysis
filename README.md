# Laptop-pricing-data-analysis
This repository contains a Python-based project for analyzing laptop pricing data. The code handles data cleaning (e.g., null/missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies) and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into factors influencing laptop prices, such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, and more.
